Not much is done yet. It has the following features:
- Autoimport. Searches the tags file for the symbol under the cursor and adds import to the module where it is declared. Default keybinding is <LocalLeader>i
- OrganizeImports. Removes duplicates, groups imports by root packages and sorts them alphabetically. It won't break your selective and renamed imports and won't touch versioned imports. Default keybinding is <LocalLeader>o

To include libraries in import search put symlinks to them in your project directory so that ctags can find the sources.
